    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An omelette is a simple dish to learn that can take a lifetime to master. With few ingredients, most of what makes a good omelette comes down to technique.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>salt and white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
